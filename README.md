# Sxift Spigot Plugin
This is my first Spigot Plugin, and my first project in Java.
I made this just to play around with the Spigot API, and test out my Java skills.
If you have any suggestions, make sure to make a Pull Request, and if you manage to find any issues,
feel free to let me know, I'll try my best to fix it, but no guarantees!
> I will keep the code up to date as long as I keep working on this Plugin.
## Version
This plugin is only supported for **Minecraft 1.12.2**.
Other versions may work, but I never tested it.
## Disclaimer
By no means this is a proper plugin, I made this purely for fun and to learn the Spigot API.
I am not responsible if you face any issues using this Plugin.

## Permissions
Use a permission plugin like
[LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/) or [GroupManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/groupmanager.38875/) 
to configure the permissions of this plugin. All the permission name starts with **Sxift**.
